I'm a foody and spend much of my time cooking, going to the local markets and enjoy restaurants. If you need some advise where to go or what to eat please ask!

In my home I offer my guests privacy. But please knock my door for questions or a chat any time and most likely we’ll meet on the terrace anyway ;)

Enjoying a city like Amsterdam is all about having a place where you feel comfortable and safe at home in a strange environment. And especially to have a good bed, a warm shower and a nice cup of coffee or tea with a stroopwafel at any time you like. In my travels I visit and visited a lot of B&B's globally. Staying in a room in somebody’s home often felt I was staying with friends. Some of them became and still are dear friends after many years. This experience is what I try to offer my guests. Live like a local, feel at home. Tot ziens in Amsterdam, Marcel.

I am Henriette, living in Amsterdam since 1983 on several places.
I was born in Eindhoven, in the South of Holland and studied at the University of Nijmegen and Amsterdam, political science and film-science.

Many years I worked as a film/video/performance programmer in theatres. 
Since 1990 I am working as a TV journalist and now for many years for a current affairs program. 

I love my work. And I really enjoy going to arthouse movies, experimental cinema, music and dance.  
Traveling and seeing other cultures makes me happy, as well as meeting my family, eating with friends and biking with my partner.

I already have a B&B since 1999.  I like it so much : it enriches my life meeting all kinds of different people.

We love AIrbnb. It is a great concept. We are proud te be a member of this community and love to explore the world at other Airbnb nice places. We introduce ourselves.
We arrived in Amsterdam in 1992 ( Michiel) and 1994 (Marlous) for doing our study and since then we didn’t leave this amazing city (except all the travels and work experiences abroad) so we discovered the city at early age ( with experiencing all the good and bad things), started our career over here and now we have our family life in this lovely neighborhood which feels like a modern upgraded ghetto in the middle of the energetic city of Amsterdam.

We enjoy our family life with the kids who goes to school and has there friends nearby and playgrounds are all over around (our garden, “Vondelpark”, “Museumplein”) and within a second we leave the house for a movie (at Cinecenter Cinema near ""Leidseplein"" is our favorite) or a theatre (Stadsschouwburg at ""Leidseplein"" which also has lots of International Plays) or having drinks with friends in one of the bars or restaurant nearby (the “Pijp” or the Jordaan”). All within a short distance or a 10 or 20 minute walk. 

We love to work hard as an Photographer and an Advocate and doing sports like racecycling, jogging, yoga and we all play tennis. We do love art and painting. We loved to travel around the world and now with our kids we downsized the distance to overcome and explore Europe with his nice countries like Italia (our favorite till so far is the lovely place Lucca) and Austria (for skieing and staying in a nice family village like Zell am See), Turkey (with the charming surfing hotspot of Alacati) and our favorite cities like Paris ( we love to eat a croissant with our kids in Parque Luxembourg) and Tarifa (for hanging around in this kite-surfing place paradise). We also enjoy simply going to the nearby beaches of Bloemendaal (Beachclub Republiek), Zandvoort ( Family Beach Vooges) or Noordwijk (Beachclub Zuiderbad) and we love to overstay a weekend in our familyhouse in Zeeland. We enjoying life with our friends and being with our lovely kids.

I'm friendly and open minded, and I really enjoy meeting people from other countries.

I have just left my job of 25 years as an accountant, to concentrate on my new career: teaching English to professionals in Amsterdam - and who knows where else in the future! Spain or Colombia springs to mind right now...

I'm aware of environmental issues, and I do my best to recycle when possible (plastics, paper, glass, old clothes etc). The electricity in my house is mostly generated from windmills. I'm not a car owner and I go everywhere by bicycle - which is very easy to do living in Amsterdam! 

International affairs interests me and I like to keep track of issues in countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Asia, Europe, the UK (Brexit??!), Ireland and Spain, among others.

Modern art is another interest, and living in Amsterdam there is no shortage of great museums to see art in, the Stedelijk museum being one of my favourites.

My girlfriend also works in hospitality.
